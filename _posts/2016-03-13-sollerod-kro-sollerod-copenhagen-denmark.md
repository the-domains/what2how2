# [Søllerød Kro - Søllerød, Copenhagen, Denmark][0]

Our first visit to Søllerød kro, a classic restaurant of the best type some 25 minutes north of Copenhagen.Seasonality and great service is found here.

In the evening we are due to see friends for a 5x 40year birthday party, so this Saturday in April 2015 we thought it would make perfect sense to have a simple lunch and to try something outside Copenhagen center.

One star by Michelin since 2007 and with 338 years Søllerød Kro is known for its great food and hospitality, let's take a look:

The food, setting & service all overflow of classic luxury, i would compare it to a Danish version of Taillevent in Paris - Luxurious ingredients and classic hospitality.

I would speculate that If Søllerød was a suburb of Paris, it would have earned 2 stars by Michelin. 

Flawless service by the team and perfectly pretty portions of perfectly cooked quality produce in season. As it should be at this level there was also perfect handling of our allergies and intolerance's. 

And the coffee was great!

Sometimes you simply lean back and think... life is good.

Are you more into the classic or modern?
